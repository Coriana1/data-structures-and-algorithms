## Approach & Efficiency
Time: O(1)
Space: O(n)

## Solution
Algorithm:
Declare function named kthFromEnd takes in head, k
	declare 2 pointers p1 and p2 = head
	for loop runs k times
		if p2 === null
			return null
		else p2 = p2.next
	while p2 not null and p2.next not null
		p1 =p1.next
		p2 = p2.next
	return p1.value
